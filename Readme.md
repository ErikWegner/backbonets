This is a TypeScript version of the Backbone tutorial found at http://ewus.de/en/tutorials/backbone.

It also features require.js (www.requirejs.org) to load the modules build by the typescript compiler.

Requirements for building:
--------------------------

npm: Node Package Manager
bower: Dependency handling for JavaScript libraries
tsc: TypeScript compiler


Building preparations:

Run the following commands at the root directory of the project

    npm install -g bower
    npm install -g tsc
    bower install

--------

To compile the scripts, run the following commands at the root of the project:

    tsc --module amd -w --sourceMap --outDir js ts/**/*.ts ts/*.ts

This file controls how _Visual Studio Code_ handles TypeScript compiling and formatting.
See https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/blob/master/docs/tsconfig.md for details.
Changing this settings may need a restart of _Visual Studio Code_.
